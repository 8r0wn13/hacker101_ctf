# Postbook

## Description
This write up will show how to solve the CTF for "Postbook"

**Difficulty:** Easy

Hints are not being provided for multiple reasons:</br>
1. It is better to figure it out yourself and I don't want to give spoilers, especially if you don't need one
2. It is only possible to get a hint every once in a while, i.e. it is not possible to get all the hints one after another. This will take too much time to "wait" for all the hints

## Solution 2nd flag
When logged in and requests are being made an id cookie is sent</br>
I copied the cookie in Cyberchef.io and with Magic it suggests it might be Base64, Hex or Hexdump</br>
