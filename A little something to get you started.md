# A little something to get you started

## Description
This write up will show how to solve the CTF for "A little something to get you started"

**Difficulty:** Trivial

Hints are not being provided for multiple reasons:</br>
1. It is better to figure it out yourself and I don't want to give spoilers, especially if you don't need one
2. It is only possible to get a hint every once in a while, i.e. it is not possible to get all the hints one after another. This will take too much time to "wait" for all the hints

## Solution
When the CTF is started it shows a main page with a welcome message</br>
Looking at the source code, it shows the following:

It shows a URL in the head with an image. When clicking on the image, it will open a new page with the flag:
