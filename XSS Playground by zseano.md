# XSS Playground by zseano

## Description
This write up will show how to solve the CTF for "XSS Playground by zseano"

**Difficulty:** Moderate

Hints are not being provided for multiple reasons:</br>
1. It is better to figure it out yourself and I don't want to give spoilers, especially if you don't need one
2. It is only possible to get a hint every once in a while, i.e. it is not possible to get all the hints one after another. This will take too much time to "wait" for all the hints
